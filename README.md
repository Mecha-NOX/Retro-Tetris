# **Tetris**

*Iconic Puzzle Gameplay | Developed in Raylib C++*

---

## **Overview**

*Tetris* is a recreation of the iconic puzzle game, where players manipulate falling blocks to create complete lines. Developed using C++ and Raylib, this project demonstrates my skills in grid-based game logic, handling piece rotation, and creating a responsive game loop for smooth gameplay.

## **Features**

- **Classic Tetris Gameplay**   
Players must arrange falling tetrominoes to complete horizontal lines, which are then cleared from the screen.

- **Piece Rotation**   
Smooth rotation of pieces to fit into the game grid.

- **Score Tracking**   
Players earn points for each line cleared, with the score displayed on the screen.

- **Increasing Difficulty**   
The game speed gradually increases as the player clears more lines, adding challenge.

- **Simple User Interface**   
Display of the player's score and the next piece, with intuitive controls.
